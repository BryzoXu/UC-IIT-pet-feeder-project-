1) I requested Copilot to "Explore real-world implementation"

My Prompt:

I would like to explore a real world implementation of this, based on my code and flow charts that I have provide you with. Can you recommend what physical hardware to use including potential types of SBCs and hardware (Like the servo and sensors) that would be needed to implement this device.

Copilot said:
"Great move, Ryan! Exploring real-world implementation will really bring your project to life. Here's a breakdown of the **hardware components** and **SBC (Single Board Computer)** options you could use to build your programmable pet feeder system:"

Copilot provided me with a range of SBCs and hardware components and explained the advantages and disadvantages for most of the items. After further discussion it came to the conclusion that either an ESP32 or Raspberry Pi Zero 2W would the best option for the project. Ive include screenshots of what is replyed with.


2) Ask copilot to write me a professional README.md 

I asked copilot to write me a professional README.md file based on my code and flow charts id provided and the previous discussion about physical hardwares, it attempted to do so but had several error and produced the document in a messy state, half being written in markdown (.md) and half written in YAML. I Copied what Copilot produced into ChatGPT 4 which was was able to converte Copilots attempt into an complete README.md document. 
I also ask ChatGPT 5 to write me a README.md document based only on my psuedo code. 

I used the Prompt

"Write me a Professional README.md file base on my psuedo code "*Code*" (I provided ChatGPT 5 with a full copy of my code.)

Its reply with the current copy of my README.md file being used in this project
I choose to use this version as it feels like better reflection of the system in it current state.
